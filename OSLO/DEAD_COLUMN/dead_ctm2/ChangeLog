	* Cleaned up wbl_mdl.F90, gmm_mdl.F90 some more and added them to libcsz_f90

2003-02-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Cleaned up wbl_mdl.F90, gmm_mdl.F90

2003-02-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed bug in drag coefficient interpolation introduced in 1.2.6.
	Bug only affected particles with 2 < Re < 5, i.e., dust particles larger
	than 80 microns diameter, so not to worry.
	I had dylexically reversed the weights. So shoot me!
	Thanks to Alan Bol for pointing	this out.

2003-01-28  Alf Grini <alf.grini@geofysikk.uio.no>

	* Still working on getting PDF winds in
	
	* Identified and fixed following bug:
	We cannot modify ovr_src_snk_mss in dstmbl.F90 because when running
	on several processors, every processor wrote to same ovr_src_snk_mss
	in dstaer module. Thus ovr_src_snk_mss in dstaer was random.
	Same was true for mss_frc_src and other variables in dstaer

	Previous version of AlG01 formulation suffered from this problem
	because ovr_src_snk_mss was constantly overwritten.
	Thus ovr_src_snk_mss used in flx_mss_vrt_dst_prt was random
	
	Fixed problem as follows:
	Created ovr_src_snk_mss_wbin and ovr_src_snk_mss_add in dstmbl
	ovr_src_snk_mss_wbin is overlap fraction for given wind speed "bin"
	ovr_src_snk_mss_add which is mean overlap fraction averaged over PDF
	Thus ovr_src_snk_mss is never overwritten

	This fix requires sending ovr_src_snk_mss_add (which can change)
	to flx_mss_vrt_dst_prt() so that flx_mss_vrt_dst_prt() uses overlap fraction
	computed in dstmbl(), _not_ overlap fraction saved in dstaer().
	flx_mss_vrt_dst_prt() no longer uses dstaer.

	* Solution (triple set of variables in dstaer) works, but is not elegant
		
	* Output variables with "_add" (e.g., mss_frc_src_add) to mbl2nc()
	
2003-01-27  Alf Grini <alf.grini@geofysikk.uio.no>

	* Fixed bug in dstmbl.F90 where previous version set mss_frc_src
	to zero if vertical flux was zero. 
	Now set mss_frc_src to previous value if fluxes are zero
	(does not matter in AlG01 formulation).
	

	* Left write statements in dstmbl to show how the the new formulation works.
	These should be taken out in a later version
	
2003-01-23  Alf Grini <alf.grini@geofysikk.uio.no>

	* Added flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_lut in dstsltsbl.F90 it is calculated in
	offline sltsbl program and accesses by
	dstmblutl.F90:flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_AlG01_get()

	* Call new subroutine from dstmbl.F90 within a "ifdef AlG01" test 

	* Changed "use dstsltsbl:only..." to "use dstsltsbl" in dstmbl.F90

2003-01-21  Alf Grini <alf.grini@geofysikk.uio.no>

        * Changed dust code to make it run with wind speed PDFs
	wbl_mdl.F90 Weibull distribution of wind speed
	gmm_mdl.F90 Gamma function gamma(x) based on libspecfun library

        * Changed dstmbl.F90 
	New parameter wnd_mdp_nbr (Number of wind midpoint bins)
        New parameter percentile (Fraction of distribution to take into account)
	New variable wnd_mdp_wgt (Weighting of wind bins)
        New variable wnd_mdp_min (Minimum wind speed to take into account)
	New variable wnd_mdp_max (Maximum wind speed to take into account)

        * Call weibull_winds just after we have wnd_rfr to calculate the
	statistical distribution of winds 

	* Call dstblm inside the loop for wnd_wbl_nbr to get wnd_rfr for
	all wnd_mdp values 

	* Introduced new variables which are only valid for a wnd_mdp bin

	* Initialize mss_frc_src ovr_src_snk_mss and so on in a special way

        * Add loop to add up quantities and weight with flx_mss_vrt_dst_ttl_wbin

	* Get global quantities by dividing them with the total flx_mss_vrt_dst_ttl

        * use dstgrd:dst_src_nbr to make tmp version of mss_frc_src and overlap fraction
	* Changes to dstblm.F90:
	No longer called with wnd_mdp_mrd and wnd_mdp_znl but simply with wnd_mdp

	* Using old version:
	New and old version are identical when wnd_mdp_nbr is set to 1

	* Outstanding problems related to AlG01 horizontal flux:
	I ran into the problem previously described by Charlie with
	respect to horizontal flux. Each wind will give a horizontal
	flux. However, using the simple horizontal flux is not OK because
	we look up the value of (alpha) which is based on a size
	distributed horizontal flux. When only calculating one wind speed,
	it is ok to say that all this disappears in the fudge factor, but
	when we have to weight with respect to flux from different wind
	speeds, this is not OK. 

	I think the AlG01 formulation should be OK too, once there is a
	subroutine called flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_AlG01_get(pick from
	lookuptable). Then the right relations between the  fluxes from
	different wind speeds should be OK. The loop which averages the
	overlap fractions and so on should be OK even for AlG01
	formulation. 

	Actually, this is problem only disappears into the fudge factor
	when using the box model. Imagine two neighboring grid cells with
	different wind speeds, they have different size distribution of
	their horizontal flux, and even though we look up "alpha", the
	absolute value of the hrz flux is different, and we don't get the
	right vertical flux. 

2003-01-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c dst-1_3_2
	Changes since dst-1_3_1: Sandblasting is optional with -DAlG01

	* Print mobilization parameterization in dst_bnr()

	* Fix Makefile to really work with USR_TKN=-DAlG01

2003-01-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Discussed with Alf the possible shortcomings of the sandblasting
	implementation. There are two main possible inconsistencies:

	First, it is unclear whether the AlG01 formulation for kinetic
	energy (KE) available to release modes should be computed from
	wnd_frc or wnd_frc_slt. 
	Should increase in wind friction speed due to saltation also
	increase the kinetic energy available for sandblasting?
	Answer is non-trivial because as saltation increases, friction
	speed increases so particles are lofted higher above the surface,
	giving them more potential energy. At the same time, the mean
	wind profile near the surface has a steeper gradient, so
	mean horizontal transport slows down, reducing the amount of 
	kinetic energy in the mean flow. However, obviously the eddy
	kinetic energy increases with turbulence, and the saltating
	particles are moving and sandblasting the surface with the eddies,
	not with the mean flow. Thus it seems appropriate to use
	wnd_frc_slt to determine the KE available for sandblasting.
	In this initial implementation, however, Alf uses wnd_frc,
	not wnd_frc_slt, to determine the KE.
	Perhaps the sensitivity to this assumption should be analyzed.
	
	Second: The original DEAD saltation code uses a "simple" saltation
	mass flux based on Whi79, flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_Whi79
	The new AlG01 saltation/sandblasting code computes a "complex"
	saltation mass flux based on AlG01, flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_AlG01.
	Thus there are two independent estimates of the same quantity.
	flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_AlG01 is determined by the sum of the
	individual saltation mass fluxes of each size of saltating soil.
	The offline lookup table code uses about 10,000 different sizes
	of saltator to determine the amount of each of the dust modes
	that are liberated. The offline code integrates the AlG01
	formulation over the parent soil distribution to determine the
	sandblasting mass efficiency of each dust mode by the given 
	soil blend for a given friction speed. It does this by knowing
	the threshold friction speed for each size saltator (computed
	off-line by mie, recall that the threshold speed does not depend on
	ambient wind speed, only on particle size). It keeps track
	of all sandblasted particles and computes the fractions of 
	total sandblasted flux that occur in each of the 3 source modes. 
	It also computes the net mass sandblasting efficiency for all the
	modes (dst_slt_flx_rat_ttl="alpha"). Given the model
	flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_Whi79 and the dst_slt_flx_rat_ttl returned by
	the lookup table, the source modes are then mapped into the
	transport modes using the matrix of overlap factors and
	mss_frc_src. Thus the reason for using flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_Whi79
	rather than flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_AlG01 in the online dust model
	is that it takes thousands of integrations to obtain
	flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_AlG01. So our philososphy was to use AlG01
	to provide the size distribution of the sandblasted dust, but
	not to provide any new information about the total horizontal
	saltation mass flux. So, it would be more consistent to archive 
	flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_AlG01 in the lookup table as well, and to 
	use that instead of flx_mss_hrz_slt_ttl_Whi79 in the online
	model. 
	
	* Since port appears clean, am removing -DAlG01 from makefile
	to make sandblasting non-default, and committing this as
	dst-1_3_2. 

	* Verified that new box model running new code (i.e., with
	sandblasting) gives identical answers to Alf's _sbl branch
	box model when inputs are identical.

	* Verified that new box model running old code (i.e., no
	sandblasting) gives same answers as old box model running old code

	AlG01 not defined.

	* Added dstsltsbl.F90

	runs are using nocoast/nopole erodibility factors.

	* Changed real(r8),intent(in),dimension(:)::obuf back to
	real(r8),intent(in)::obuf(*) because this was causing AIX

	* Finished adding _r8 to literal constants and results to most routines.
	Answers are BFB with dst-0_9_8 when debugging options (-g)
	employed. Huzzah. Passing literal constants to functions may not
	have been a problem before, and should not be in the future.
	Note that [dst-0_9_9b--dst-1_0_9] are only BFB with dst-0_9_8 when
	compiled with debugging option (-g). 
	I thought debugging and optimized (-O2) versions were supposed 
	to be BFB with all compilers but perhaps not.

	and dust burden is ridiculous

	* Use msrcp.pl for rdsp

	* Use -UWETDEP to ensure default wet dep is turned off
	and use true to ensure my wet dep is turned on

2001-10-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c match-4_0_beta2-dst-1_0_7 match match_dst
	* cvs tag -c dst-1_0_7
	1_0_7 tag used for testing new merged code.
	Tests include dstmch67
	
	* Global model now compiles on dust and krein, and fails in
	boundary dataset ingest because of old boundary datasets

	* phyzlic.F90 (phyzlic): Wrapped phyzlic.F90, like aer.F90,
	in #ifdef BXM tokens so box model does not look for a history module

2001-10-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* To resolve these dependencies, added src_scyc to match_brnch_dst 

	* Match 4.X files which fulfill dependencies of files
	in src: 
	src/caer.F90 depends on src_scyc/error_messages.F90,
	src/drydepdr.F depends on src_scyc/scyc.F90
	
	* Match 4.X files modified for match_dst branch that should
	be modified upstream in vanilla match distribution:
	src/fca2cs.c, src/dyninp.F moved to readers/ccm directory,
	readers/mss.c, readers/ncep/dyninp.F,
	src/main.F namelist does not compile on SGI

	* Changed pmgrid.F90 to fixed-format pmgrid.F and made pmgrid.h
	fixed-format to support Match fixed format files

	* Renamed dstszdst.F90 as dstpsd.F90, szdstlgn.F90 as psdlgn.F90
	Replace szdst by psd (particle size distribution) everywhere

	* Removed hbuf and wrhstts from all MATCH outfld() calls
	Replaced hbuf with lchnk and wrhstts with ncol for CAM 
	compatibility

	* cvs tag -c dst-1_0_6
	dst-1_0_6 tag is for the match4_0_beta2 merge

2001-10-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c dst-1_0_5
	Changes since dst-1_0_4: bck_cff_mss information

	* sng_mdl.F90: Adopted free-format version from libcsz_f90

	* dstodx.F90: Added backscatter coefficient for LIDAR assimilation

2001-10-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Began implementation of nf90_wrp for most netCDF I/O
	This improves error diagnostics substantially

2001-10-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nf90_utl.F90 (nf90_wrp): New function to handle errors
	generically, i.e., a dumb wrapper, not as good as routine-specific
	wrappers, but it works.

	* cvs tag -c dst-1_0_4
	Changes since dst-1_0_3: All .F90 files are now free-format,
	model executes and is BFB with BXM of dst-0_9_9

	* Began adding only: clauses to module usage

	* Successfully built, linked, and executed Fortran90 model

2001-10-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Re-organized common variable initialization, formerly known
	as common block initialization.
	Goal is to place routines to initialize variables in the modules
	where those variable are actually used.
	dstcst.F90 now only has dst_cst_cmn_ini to initialize physical constants
	New module dstdbg.F90 handles debugging constants from dst_msc_cmn
	New routine dst_blm_cmn_ini() placed in dstblm.F90
	dstcmnini.F90 is now a wrapper for initializing many modules
	dst_odx_cmn_ini moved to dstodx.F90
	dst_scv_cmn_ini moved to dstscv.F90
	dst_chm_cmn_ini moved to dstchm.F90
	
2001-10-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c dst-1_0_3
	Changes since dst-1_0_2: All Fortran code is now in .F90 files
	but some .F90 files are still fixed-format. Will change this now.

	* Modified everything else to use these modules

	* Moved *.h files into corresponding modules for 
	aernvr.h dstaer.h dstbdg.h dstblm.h dstchm.h dstcst.h
	dstctl.h dstgrd.h dstszdst.h dstszdstbd.F dstlsm.h dstlsmbd.F
	dstmsc.h dstnm.h dstodx.h dstrad.h dstradbd.F dstscv.h dstsfc.h 
	dsttibds.h dsttvbds.h
	
	* Converted .F files into .F90 files which contain the
	applicable .h files, creating
	  dstcst.F90 aernvr.F90 dstgrd.F90 dstaer.F90 pmgrid.F90
          dstlsm.F90 dstrad.F90 dstscv.F90 dstsfc.F90 dsttibds.F90
	  dsttvbds.F90 aer.F90 blmutl.F90 dpsdryutl.F90 dstblm.F90
	  dstbdg.F90 dstchm.F90 dstcmnini.F90 dstctl.F90 dstdpsdry.F90
	  dstdpswet.F90 dstmbl.F90 dstmblutl.F90 dstmssutl.F90
	  dstszdst.F90 phyzlic.F90 szdstlgn.F90 
	
	* cvs tag -c dst-1_0_2
	Changes since dst-1_0_1: Answers have not changed
	Free format F90 codes from libcsz_f90 are now default

	* Converted from 1p,e8.1,0p to es8.1 format string

	* Replaced sng_f77.F  utl_f77.F  vec_f77.F  xtr_f77.F by F90

	* Use dbg_mdl instead of include dbg.com, xtr_mdl instead of xtr.com

2001-09-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* szdstlgn.F: appended _r8 suffix to naked constants

	* cvs tag -c dst-1_0_1
	Changes since dst-1_0_0:
	Adds dbg_mdl and erf_mdl, still builds fine and is BFB with
	dst-0_9_9 (in box model mode only, since global VAI has changed)

	* erf_mdl.F90 (main): changed erf.F to erf_mdl.F90
	This should allow building on AIX, ALPHA

2001-09-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

        * dst-1_0_0 compiles and runs on most platforms but dies
	with error on AIX when with OPTS=X. 
	Considering making all interfaces Fortran90 in order to help
	catch more potential errors

	* cvs tag -c dst-1_0_0
	dst-1_0_0 merges CCM branch changes into F90 code:
	Answer changing physics:
	VAI from CLM is default, LSM may still be selected with switch
	dst_dps_wet() returns fracis=frc_trc_trn_cnv_ptn= fraction of
	aerosol available for convective transport
	dst_dps_wet_old() also returns frc_trc_trn_cnv_ptn, but definition
	is necessarily different since available cloud diagnostics differ
	dst_dps_wet_old relies only on cloud diagnostics available in CCM
	3.3.6 physics. Also note that CCM aphys() and conv_ccm() must be
	re-written to make use of interstitial fraction. In particular,
	convtran() must be extracted from conv_ccm() and called from
	aphys() after dst_dps_wet().
	
	* szdstlgn.F: modularized szdstlgn routines

	* Makefile (dbg): Added -I${NETCDF_LIB} to find netcdf.mod

	* Removed superfluous netcdf.inc from many files

	* Added start= and count= qualifiers to most optional arguments in 
	get_var and put_var functions

	* Fixed bug introduced in F90 port where start and count indices
	were removed from get_var routines in tvbds and tibds routines

2001-09-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Merged CCM branch changes of 9/12-9/20 into main trunk:
	aer.F,.cvsignore,ChangeLog,TODO,Makefile

	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_9d

	* Undid all pjones changes to pmgrid.h, added precision.F90
	to main trunk

	* cvs tag -c match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_9c
	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_9c
	* dst-0_9_9c is F90 branch merged back into main trunk
	i.e., same as 0_9_9b but code is on main trunk not branch

2001-09-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>
	* cvs tag -c match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_9b
	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_9b
	* dst-0_9_9b code merges snow fraction changes into pjones branch 
	i.e., match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_9 merged into dst-0_9_8_F90

2001-09-19  Patrick Jones  <pajones@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_8_F90
	* Changes: Branch point code with fully working F90 netCDF interface	

2001-09-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

        * Today's changes all in CCM branch

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore to CCM branch

2001-09-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

        * Today's changes all in CCM branch

	* dstmblutl.F (lnd_frc_mbl_get): CLM VAI -> lnd_frc_mbl in CCM branch

2001-09-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

        * Today's changes all in CCM branch

	* aer.F (dst_sfc_set): Default to vai_dst from tvbds, allow
	old LSM vai_dst by setting flag in lnd_frc_mbl
	(aer): sorted command line options, added vai_dst in CCM branch

2001-09-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

        * Today's changes all in CCM branch

	* dstmblutl.F (lnd_frc_mbl_get): wrote tm_2_idx_wgt() to 
	handle computing bracketing indices of mid-month values
	and weights relative to current day of year
	(vai_lsm_get): compute vai not lai 

	* dsttvbds.F (dst_tvbds_ntp): Changed lai_dst to vai_dst,
	lai_lsm to vai_ttl_clm so that host model receives
	satellite-derived gridcell average VAI as used by CLM2.

	* dstmblutl.F (lnd_frc_mbl_get): Changed lai to vai

	* Noticed minor but annoying discrepencies between CCM and
	Match 0_9_9 tags crept into ChangeLog utl_f77.F and sng_f77.F 
	Too hard to fix since must get Erik Kluzek to untag BranchSum

2001-09-12  Patrick Jones  <pajones@uci.edu>

	* Fixed netCDF calls in bdg_update in dstbdg.F to correspond to F90.

	* Cleaned up some syntax in comments.
	
2001-09-12  Patrick Jones  <pajones@uci.edu>

	* Major change is the conversion of the netCDF interface from F77 to 
	F90. These changes are mostly cosmetic, involving the syntax of 
	netCDF routine calls, and the order of arguments in some calls.

	* The model now uses the precision module for its precision 
	information. Switching between single and double precision can now be
	accomplished by one line changes to precision.F90. There are also 
	syntactical changes associated with this, such as going from real to 
	real(r8), and so forth.

	* Most of the .F files have been modularized, with use statements
	inserted in the proper locations in each module and/or subroutine.

2001-09-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_9
	* cvs tag -c ccm3_6_6_brnchT_dst-0_9_9
	* cvs tag -c match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_9
	* dst-0_9_9 changes:
	Box model: snow height -> snow fraction conversion
	CCM: Fixed comments in tphysac
	Match: None

	* Improved comments in ccm_dst calling args to dst_dps_dry()

	* dstmblutl.F (snw_frc_get): Changed bulk density of snow from
	250.0 to 100.0 kg m-3 in accord with old CCM value and WiW80.
	New density represents top layer of dry snow, 
	not packed snow (which is too deep to allow dust deflation),
	or wet snow (which constrains mobilization through soil moisture).
	This changes answers in snowy regions.
	
2001-09-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Makefile: Updated with new ALPHA, AIX builds and recognition of
	.F90 and .mod files 

2001-08-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* utl_f77.F (mnt_ncr_chk): Fixed bug in mnt_ncr_chk() and
	mnt_dcr_chk(). Routines could have returned wrong flag if
	array contained negative numbers with certain spacing.

2001-07-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* aer.F (nvr2nc): Added global attributes including cmd_ln so that
	box model retains its history

2001-07-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

        * Branch point for implementation of Fortran90 precision.mod & netCDF
	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_8
        * cvs tag -c match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_8
        * cvs tag -b -r match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_8 match_brnch_dst_pjones match_dst
	
	* sng_f77.F (ftn_strlen): Protected namespace of all functions in
	sng_f77.F by prefixing them with ftn_. The ftn_ prefix should be 
	applied to all fortran functions/subroutines that may be exposed
	to other libraries so that architectures which do not
	differentiate between fortran and C symbol names do not get
	confused. Specifically, this is intended to fix linking errors on
	AIX machines, but it is always good practice to have a
	three-letter identifier in from of library routines.

2001-07-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_7_AIX
	This tag incorporates all the changes required to get AIX to compile
	
	* Makefile: Heavy modifications to allow AIX compiling
	Box model now compiles on AIX. However, model will not run until
	namespace conflict with fortran string handling routines is addressed.

	* dstcmnini.F (dst_scv_cmn_ini): Removed hanging token after #endif

	* dstsfc.h (main): Broken dst_htd_lsm into two commons to satisfy
	AIX compiler that reals and logicals will not be mis-aligned

	* Fixed whitespace problems with PRC and DBG tokens

	* dstscv.F (dst_scv): Changed q_dst_cld_min, q_trc_tnd_scv_eps
	from 1.0e-100 to 1.0e-30 in accord with PJR to work with single
	precision

	* blmutl.F (blm_glb): Backed out changes used to debug
	dry deposition problems kept in dst-0_9_7_dry_dps_dbg.

	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_7_dry_dps_dbg
	This tag contains the mods to call and directly compare flxsice()
	instead of blm_???() for dry deposition. These mods may be useful
	in the future. Inputs to dry dep are hardwired to not-converge due
	to large roughness length. However convergence appears to be
	guaranteed when correct boundary data and surface type info are
	used, i.e., boundary layers found on Earth will converge.

	* sng_f77.F (int_arg_get): Fixing format descriptors to be
	strictly standard compliant and always specify a numeric width.

2001-07-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstmblutl.F (lnd_frc_mbl_get): Added second min() to pln_frc_mbl 
	to prevent roundoff error pln_frc_mbl < 0.0 on PGF90 compiler
	This fixes lnd_frc_mbl ~ -1.0e-8 on sfc_typ = 12, 15, 16.
	
2001-07-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* aer.F (aer): Added more command line inputs: oro, sfc_typ,
	hgt_mdp, prs_ntf

	* blmutl.F (blm_ice): wrote wrapper for Large's flxsice() and
	called identically to blm_ice(). Results appear to agree almost 
	bit for bit. Differences are easily explained by two differences
	in algorithms: dust model does not correct sea-ice saturation
	specific humidity for salinity effects, and dust model always uses
	latent heat of sublimation over sea ice. Routines also use
	different formulae for saturation vapor pressure. In any case, 
	results appear identical and seem to rule out coding errors in
	translation. Perhaps number of iterations can be reduced over
	sea-ice due to frequently stable conditions? 

	flxsice appears to give very close results to blm_lnd, as well.
	blm_lnd uses sublimation or evaporation, depending on temperature.
	Also blm_lnd does not apply salinity correction to ssh. 
	Thus results are expected to differ slightly with flxsice and they
	do. Certainly no indication of coding errors.	

	* sng_f77.F (int_arg_get): Created int_arg_get() to parse command
	line integer arguments

2001-07-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verified single precision and double precision box models
	agree to machine precision with standard profiles

	* dstdpswet.F (cld_dgn,dst_dps_wet): Changed pcp_flx_sfc_min,
	q_dst_cld_min, q_trc_tnd_scv_eps from 1.0e-100 to 1.0e-30 in
	accord with PJR to work with single precision 

	* dstscv.h (main): Fixed redundant dimension for frc_ice_scv

	* Makefile (FFLAGS): Implemented PRC=D and PRC=S options for
	command line switching between D=Double precision (default)
	and S=Single precision

2001-07-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* blmutl.F (blm_lnd): Added relative convergence eps_crr
	diagnostic for wind friction speed convergence
	Also improved diagnostics to blm_ice(), blm_ocn()

	* Makefile: Removed unecessary libcsz_f77 link dependencies

	* dstscv.F (clc_fsh_get): Fixed dangling comment on #endif

	* dstbdg.F (bdg_update): Protected divide by zero errors on two
	diagnostics which could occur when dust mobilization was zero.

	* Running dstmch65 to test effect of turbulent dry deposition fix

2001-07-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* aer.F (aer_nvr_cmn_cmd_ln_dfl): Implemented this routine to
	initialize common block members whose values may be overridden by
	command line input. These initializations were removed from their
	former locations in aer_nvr_cmn_ini(). No provision is made for
	passing arrays of command-line inputs, only scalars are allowed
	so plev,plon,plat must all equal 1 for command line input feature
	to function as intended.

	* blmutl.F (blm_glb): Fixed bogus orography sanity check

	* Fixed compilation of dstchm.F when DST_DBG is enabled

	* Added DBG=Y option to box model Makefile

        * Fixed removal of NCEP files, by modifying mss.c MSSclear

	* Implemented long option command line parsing

	* Fixed sending wrong vertical level to dry dep routines
	This bug has been present in all versions of the dust version
	2 dry dep code. It affected turbulent deposition, but not
	gravitational sedimentation or any other processes.
	This bug did not affect the box model at all, only models
	with multiple vertical levels.

2001-07-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Merged updated sng_f77.F nc_f77.F into dust model

	* Merged this code with CCM 3.6.6, creating ccm3_6_6_brnchT_dst-0_9_7
	Woops, unable to tag CCM because of CVS problems
	
	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_7

	* cvs tag -c match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_7

2001-07-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstszdst.F (grd_mk): Fixed harmless overwrite of calling
	parameters sz_grd_min and sz_grd_max by themselves

2001-06-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstszdst.F (dst_szdst_ini): Moved sanity checks to end of
	routine so cause of printed error may be determined from banner
	information 

2001-06-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c dst-0_9_6
	is tag for bugfixed dry dep and wet dep routines:
	Fixed cwat argument to as1(), and blm_[lnd,atm,ocn]() loops.
	This version uses wet dep with PSD for size-dependent scavenging,
	DSD for separation of strat and convective precip is also on.

	* Cleaned up Makefile

2001-06-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Committed bugfix for dry dep boundary layer routines

	* PJR reported serious bug in blmutl.F where blm_ocn,blm_ice, and
	blm_lnd all were incorrectly split into two loops and variables
	initialized in one were static 

2001-04-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed condensed cloud water argument to dst_dps_wet().
	Used to be cwat but that was only appropriate for archived cloud water
	Diagnosed condensed cloud water could and should use the
	constituent array as1(1,1,pcnst)
	
2001-04-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* F90 build on f77 source appears to work again
	PJR has converted source to F90 in 
	/fs/cgd/home0/pjr/match/devbranch
	and I will attempt merging these changes once I get the module
	precedence handled correctly in the Makefile

2000-12-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Ran dstmch61: New wet dep 

2000-09-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Comparing 1998 simulations of Barbados
	dstmch51--dstmch57 are not dramatically different
	Later simulations have physics (collection) which give them longer
	lifetime, but mean concentrations at Barbados do not change by more
	than 40%, and event occurence does not change, just intensity.
	Ran dstmch58 same as dstmch55,56 except uses OLD wet deposition
	scheme based on TeF94. 

	dstmch58 has same mean concentration at Barbados as dstmch57, 
	which is 20--40% greater than dstmch51--56.
	Variability still much weaker than dstmch41 which best simulated
	mean and variability at Barbados.

2000-08-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged dst-0_9_5, testing with 1-year dstmch57 run

	* Continuous raindrop distribution made convective rain less
	generally less efficient at scavenging all dust sizes.

	* Changed scavenging coefficients in dst_scv_cmn_ini() to include
	continuous size distribution of raindrops. Formerly assumed
	monodisperse raindrop distribution. Transition from interception
	to impaction regime is now < factor of 10 in high resolution mode.

2000-08-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Results of dstmch56 look reasonable. Enhanced total column
	aerosol path and surface concentration is especially pronounced in
	the Caribbean. However, transition of scavenging coefficient from
	interception to impaction regime is too sharp, even in
	high-resolution cases. Changes can be factors of 30--100 from one 
	aerosol size bin to the next. This is largely due to monodisperse
	raindrop distribution.

	* Tagged dst-0_9_4, testing with 1-year dstmch56 run

	* Finished initial implementation of size-dependent scavenging
	coefficients. 

	* Reimplemented ice fraction of condensate but added new
	frc_ice_scv weight which is 1.0 for dust, 0.0 for SO4

	* Distinguishing below cloud scavenging coefficients 
	in convective and stratiform rain.
	Stratiform scavenging: dmt_pcp=400  um, flx_vlm_pcp=1   mm hr-1
	Convective scavenging: dmt_pcp=1000 um, flx_vlm_pcp=3.6 mm hr-1

2000-08-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstmch55 is 1-year test simulation of match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_3

	* Retagged match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_3

	* Fixed a problem with order of initialization of dynamic input
	arrays in stk_crc_get()

	* Added timeout code to readers/ncep/mss.c:MSSget() so model dies
	after more than 15 minutes waiting for NCEP data.

2000-08-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged version match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_3. This version contains
	initial mods for size dependent wet scavenging in dstscv.F
	Initialization of dst_odx_cmn_ini() and dst_szdst_ini() are
	now in correct order. Ran dstmch55 to test code.

2000-06-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* There are still small sources around North Sea, Belgium, Ireland
	Check if this is fixed by the LAI multiplication patch.
	
2000-06-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged version used for dstmch54 as match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_2
	This is the tag Brian will use to put the new dust in to the
	assimilation model.

	* Ran dstmch54 with snow deposition allowed

	* Dust is allowed to nucleate ice, thus convective and stratiform
	snow is allowed to remove dust 

	* Add extra sanity check to dst_mbl that stops model when
	environment, not dust, has gone haywire

	* Once qneg3(afterSPF) call was disabled by default,
	qneg3() became triggered most often by VDIFF so the size of the
	log file did not shrunk very much, and VDIFF looked like
	the culprit when really the spitfire advection module created
	ALL the negative dust mixing ratios. So revert to enabling
	qneg3(afterSPF) by default. 

	* Examination of log file in 1 year run dstmch51 shows statistics
	for production of negative mixing ratios by physical process:

	dst_mbl produces 0 (none)
	dst_wet produces 0 (none)
	dst_dry produces 0 (none)
	VDIFF produces 0 (none) for dust or cloudwater
	APHYS_az produces 48 (about 1 per week) for cloudwater, none for dust
	APHYSARz produces 259 (about 1 per day) for dust, none for cloudwater
	afterSPF produces 603000 (about 45 per 2400 s timestep) for dust
	
	* Tagged version used for dstmch53 as match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_1

2000-06-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstmch53 fixes LAI multiplication bug caught by Natalie
	
	* Turned off DST_DBG and DST_MSS_BDG by default on SGI and CRAY

	* Changed to new optics with globally uniform rds_nma=0.2986 and
	gsd=2.0. Previous optics employed rds_nma=bin center. For standard
	4 size class runs this means changing, at 0.63 um, from 
	ext_cff_mss_dst_063_04bn=(/ 2886.75,734.911,329.408,158.602 /) to
	ext_cff_mss_dst_063_04bn=(/ 2892.77,835.046,382.509,196.051 /)
	
	* Turned of afterSPF qneg3() call to reduce log file size and check
	mass conservation. 99% of QNEG3() calls occur afterSPF.

2000-06-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstmch52 uses spc_xsx_cll_scv=0.05 instead of 0.1. 
	This increases turnover time for wet deposition by about 1.3 days
	For some reason the one year version of this ran as dstmch51
	
	* dstmch51 uses spc_xsx_ncl_scv=0.05 instead of 0.1. 
	This had no effect on turnover time due to wet deposition. 
	Apparently nucleation scavenging does nothing and collision
	scavenging is responsible for everything.

2000-06-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstmch50 use local cloud instead of cld_pcp_wgt for in-cloud
	scavenging. This increases turnover time for wet depostion by
	about 1 full day.

	* dstmch04 mass budget diagnostics

2000-06-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	    DSTTAUP04 578701	6.7	 1664119       19.3

	* Finished 1-year test of BRK wet deposition scheme for 1998
	Comparing dstmch49 to dstmch46 with only wet deposition changed:
	dstmch46 Old wet dps scheme DSTMPC=4.3053e-05 KG/M2, DSTODXC=0.0318116 FRACTION
	dstmch49 BRK wet dps scheme DSTMPC=2.42303e-05 KG/M2, DSTODXC=0.0192631 FRACTION
	Mobilization is unchanged so BRK is nearly twice as efficient

2000-06-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Removed initial nstep=0 bdg_update() call in MATCH so that
	dst_mss_bdg.nc records are synchronized with history tapes 

	* Implemented correct conversion of mixing ratios from dry to wet
	and back again in each timestep of box model to keep mass
	diagnostics from drifting in box model (global models already
	handled this correctly of course)

2000-06-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Annotated timesplitting rationale in dstbdg.F

	* Fixed problem where tm_dlt was not initialized in bdg_cmn_ini():
	Put tm_dlt initialization at top of aer.F in box model
	Cast delt to real in bdg_cmn_ini() call in inirun() in MATCH 

2000-05-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Updating Match for new physics: switched order of initialization
	of dst_szdst_ini() and dst_msc_cmn_ini()

2000-05-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implemented Rasch and Barth wet deposition scheme

2000-05-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Model should now run "correctly" when arbitrary number of size
	bins. Most significant remaining problem is that complete optical
	properties are not interpolated, just optical dept is. As a
	result, radiative forcing is zero unless pre-computed tables are
	available to be used. Currently only have precomputed table for
	dst_nbr = 4.

	* Implemented automated size binning for arbitrary dst_nbr.
	Moved all size grid information except source bin distributions
	from dstszdstbd() to dst_szdst_ini()

	* Implemented default radiative forcing properties as 0.0 when
	pre-computed properties are not available

	* Added smart interpolation for optical depth information when
	pre-computed properties are not available

	* Broke out optical depth into own common block dstodx and
	initialization routint dst_odx_cmn_ini()

	* Switched order so dst_szdst_ini() is called before dst_msc_cmn_ini()

2000-04-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstmch46: 1998 re-run with dry dep. bugfix

	* Added qneg3_dgn() to archive tendencies from mass limiter

2000-04-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Found and fixed bug in dst_dps_dry() 

2000-04-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Turned dst_wet_dps() back on and turned dst_dps_dry() off.

2000-04-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Turned off dst_dps_wet() to check for mass balance.
	Mass balanced only worsened. This definitively rules out
	dst_dps_wet() as the sole problem---although it may be a part of a 
	larger problem.

	* PRECT != PRECT2 --> is there a units problems in dst_wet_dps()?

2000-04-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added mpc_dst_a_trn, mpc_dst_a_trn_qng, mpc_dst_a_fxr dianostics

2000-04-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Disabling CaCO3 for mass tests

	* Set fixmas=.true. to invoke mass fixer and evaluate size of
	advective contribution to mass imbalance

	* Tagged match-3_3_23-dst-0_9_0

2000-03-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dstmch45 is a CaCO3 tracer test in 1998. Results look good.

	* Implemented capability to transport CaCO3 as a tracer 

	* dstmch43 is a one day run archiving every timestep to check for
	mass conservation

2000-01-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged dst-0_8_9

	* Ran dstmch37-44

1999-11-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Added coastal filter to reduce basin emission on coasts and
	islands. Ran dstmch36 beginning in May 1998. 

	* dstmch35 looks good. DSTODXC = 0.04, DSTMPC = 57 mg m-2.

1999-11-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Results look good, except Caspian sea and Horn of Africa too
	strong. Changed vwc_thr to 0.17+0.14*mss_frc_cly to reintroduce
	direct dependence on clay fraction. Ran dstmch35 for 1 year.

1999-11-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Changed from flx_mss_fdg_fct=1.0e-4 to 5.0e-4, ran dstmch34

1999-11-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged dst-0_8_8, ran dstmch33

	* Testing topographic source limitations (based on Ginoux)

	* Reactivated frc_thr_wet_fct but changed vwc_thr to 0.20 so that
	only very moist soils (such as Iceland) are proscribed as sources.

1999-11-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged dst-0_8_7

	* Changed flx_mss_fdg_fct to 1.0e-4, ran dstmch32

	* Began changing old aer code to F90 syntax

	* Changed flx_mss_fdg_fct to 1.0e-3, ran dstmch31, looks OK,
	vwc_sfc appears correct, GAA ODXC = 0.61

1999-10-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@flagstaff.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged dst-0_8_6

	* Added routines necessary to set radiative fluxes, surface
	temperatures, and soil moisture in MATCH

1999-10-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged as match-3_3_23-dst-0_8_5

	* Removed dependence on date_time.c so that box-model is truly
	standalone. Rewrote Makefile to build box-model in local
	directory. Implemented Fortran90 date_time_get() routine.

	* Updated to match-3_3_23, tagged as match-3_3_23-dst-0_8_4

	* Adjustments by Brian Eaton for match-3_3_20-dst-0_8_4

	* Merged with match-3_3_20, tagged as match-3_3_20-dst-0_8_3

1999-09-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as aer-0_8_3

	* Merged params.h from box model, CCM, and MATCH together so that
	dst module params.h controls all three models.

	* Changed SCM token to BXM for "Box model" to avoid possible
	future conflicts with CCM SCCM tokens.

	* Tagged this as aer-0_8_2

	* Merged into dst directory of match_dst

1999-09-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as aer-0_8_1

	* Added more time and date functionality. Verified behavior of

	agree with MATCH. 

1999-08-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Implemented rudimentary time-stepping capapbility with tm2nc()
	and dstctl.h

1999-08-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as aer-0_7_5

1999-08-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as aer-0_7_4 Prior to merging with match-3_3_20

1999-08-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as aer-0_7_3

	* Segregated chemistry routines into dst_chm_rxr() to solve for

1999-08-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as aer-0_7_2

	* Added alpha heterogeneous chemistry routines for HNO3

1999-07-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Implemented blm_glb(), blm_lnd(), blm_ocn(), and blm_ice().
	Verified BFB agreement between mie and aer for these routines.

1999-07-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tweaked CCM_LW to give better agreement with GSFC_LW

1999-07-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Added GSFC LW capability

1999-07-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Removed __GNUC__ tokens for automatic allocation in vec_f77.F
	and in csz_f77.F. Now code _must_ be compiled with f90 or with g77.

1999-07-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as aer-0_7_1

1999-07-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Verified blm_ocn() is BFB between aer() and mie()
	Technique for this is to add blm_ocn() call just after
	blm_mbl() in dstmbl.F. Then compare with, e.g., 
	mie -tpt_sst=311. Also validated diagnostic computations
	of xch_cff_mmn and of wnd_rfr at end of blm_ocn() are BFB.

1999-06-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

Mon Jun 21 10:17:56 1999  ZENDER CHARLIE 1445 ML CGD  <zender@dataproc.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this version as aer-0_7_0, sent to Natalie

1999-06-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@flagstaff.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed default size distribution modes as SBG98 rather than BSM96

Sun Jun  6 14:57:25 1999  ZENDER CHARLIE 1445 ML CGD  <zender@dataproc.ucar.edu>

	* dstccm28 results: Relaxing frc_thr_wet_fct from FMB99 by a
	factor of 3 reduced the spikiness of the dust source regions
	considerably. 

	* Ran dstccm28: LSM=IGBP cly=0.20 frcwet/=0.33 fdg=0.001

Sat Jun  5 22:07:26 1999  ZENDER CHARLIE 1445 ML CGD  <zender@dataproc.ucar.edu>

	* dstccm25--27 results: Changing from Webb to IGBP soil texture for
	the LSM improved unrealistic waterline at 20 N in the Sahara.

	* Ran dstccm27: LSM=IGBP cly=0.20 rghmbl=100 rghsmt=33 LAI<0.2 fdg=0.01
	* Ran dstccm26: LSM=IGBP cly=0.15 rghmbl=100 rghsmt=33 LAI<0.2 fdg=0.01
	* Ran dstccm25: LSM=IGBP cly=0.10 rghmbl=100 rghsmt=33 LAI<0.2 fdg=0.01 
	The header ctitle is mistaken on dstccm25, cly really was 0.10
	
	* Changed default soil texture dataset for LSM to IGBP (IBIS)

	* dstccm24 was a botched attempt to put IGBP soil into LSM
	I changed routine fsurdat but forgot that now LSM only uses fsurdat
	when finidat='arbitrary initialization'

Thu Jun  3 21:34:29 1999  ZENDER CHARLIE 1445 ML CGD  <zender@dataproc.ucar.edu>

	* dstccm04 results: Fixing SGS mss_frc_cly at 0.10 rather than
	0.15 causes tremendous differences, nearly all of them
	undesirable. First, Botswana (Kalahari) becomes the strongest
	source in May, beating both East Asia and the Sahara by a factor
	of about three. Of these sources, only the Kalahari is dry enough
	to avoid triggering the vwc_thr penalties in frc_thr_wet_fct.

	* Ran dstccm04: IBIS 1.0*vwc cly=0.10 rghmbl=100
	rghsmt=33 cld=0.85 fdg=0.01  

	* dstccm23 results: Realizing that the nearly linear dependence of
	vwc_thr upon mss_frc_cly was now primarily responsible for
	inhibiting African relative to Asian sources, and that limiting
	mss_frc_cly to < 0.05 for only some mobilization routines was
	physically inconsistent, it became obvious that a single
	mss_frc_cly should be used for all mobilization physics, and that
	then vwc would not need to be tuned. Setting SGS mss_frc_cly to
	0.15 imposed a global vwc_thr of about 0.03 m3 m-3. Setting SGS
	vwc equal to vwc_sfc increased African sources, which are
	seaonally very close to 0.03, relative to Asian sources, which are
	closer to 0.05 m3 m-3. As a result, the African sources look just
	about right, although there is too sharp a cutoff in sources north
	of 20N. This cutoff is due to the abrupt change of frc_thr_wet_fct
	from ~1 to ~3 at that latitude, which is, in turn, due to vwc_sfc.
	Higher vwc_sfc north of 20N unmistakably follows the 
	patterns of soil texture, specifically clay, in LSM's Webb dataset.
	Western Australia is now also significant, but not unreasonable. 
	The Patagonian source disappeared, which is fine,
	but so did nearly all of the Baluchistani and Caspian sources,
	which is not good. The Horn of Africa, much too strong in June and
	July in earlier	versions, is now...
	Arabian peninsula and sea are virtually devoid of dust in May.
	Note that overall, source locations are extremely spiky, rather
	than covering diffuse regions. The locations generally agree,
	e.g., TOMS hotspots, but the spikiness is too extreme. Solving
	this may require relaxing the LAI restriction from vai_mbl_thr=0.2
	to, e.g., 0.4 m2 m-2.

	* Ran dstccm23: IBIS 1.0*vwc cly=0.15 rghmbl=100
	rghsmt=33 cld=0.85 fdg=0.01  

	* Changed to mss_frc_cly=0.15 for SGS mobilization routines
	Reset vwc_sgs to 1.0*vwc_sfc
	
	* Result: Fixing cld_frc at 0.85 instead of setting it equal to
	the interactive cloud fraction was necessary to reduce the
	overly long-lived, and hence overly diffuse, distribution of dust
	far from the sources. The 0.85 cloud fraction was obtained from
	the Dust model version 1, e.g., dst16 and dst17 to yield a
	lifetime of 12-19 days for submicron dust. Note that this is
	obviously a short term fix, and that using PJR's wet deposition
	routine will probably be the best long term fix.

	* Ran dstccm22: IBIS 0.4*vwc cly<0.05 rghmbl=100
	rghsmt=33 cld=0.85 fdg=0.01  

	* Changed to cld_frc=0.85 for dstdpswet()

	* dstccm21 results: Reducing mss_frc_cly from 0.10 to 0.05 (for
 	the computation of dst_slt_flx_rat_ttl only) essentially removed
 	all sensitivity of dst_slt_flx_rat_ttl to mss_frc_cly. This
 	certainly improved strength of Saharan sources relative to East
 	Asian, but the increase of mss_frc_cly on vwc_thr still allowed
 	moister Asian sources to dominate drier African sources. The
 	absolute strength of the Asian source looks good, but is much too
 	strong relative to the African source. The African source has
 	developed the desired trans-Atlantic characteristics. The Asian
 	sources centered near Baluchistan and the Caspian are desirable
 	but will disappear in dstccm23, presumably due to more stringent
 	moisture criteria.  The Patagonian source is too strong (relative
 	to Africa).

	* Ran dstccm21: IBIS 0.4*vwc cly<0.05 rghmbl=100 rghsmt=33 fdg=0.01

	* Changed to mss_frc_cly < 0.05, rgh_mmn_mbl=100.0e-6,
	rgh_mmn_smt=33.3e-6

Wed Jun  2 19:47:24 1999  ZENDER CHARLIE 1445 ML CGD  <zender@dataproc.ucar.edu>

	* dstccm20 results: Decreasing rgh_mmn_mbl to 50 um decreased the
	stress partitioning from frc_thr_rgh_fct = 1.57 to 1.34, which was
	good, but not enough to activate any Saharan sources. Realized
	that decreasing rgh_mmn_mbl also reduces wnd_frc, because the SGS
	surface is now smoother. Increasing vwc_sgs from 0.2 to
	0.4*vwc_sfc succeeded in removing some obviously non-arid source
	regions. However, relatively moist regions with high soil clay
	content were still able to deflate due to nearly linear
	FMB99 relationship between vwc_thr and mss_frc_cly. Note that
	until dstccm23, mss_frc_cly was only reduced in computation of
	dst_slt_flx_rat_ttl, but was not reduced consistently in other
	SGS physics such as the vwc_thr determination. Regions with 
	mss_frc_cly < 0.10, such as much of the Sahara, were thus still at
	a significant disadvantage in mobilization because of the combined
	effects of reduced vwc_thr and reduced dst_slt_flx_rat_ttl
	relative to moister regions with mss_frc_cly > 0.10.
	The Patagonian source is too strong, and the the source of nearly
	all the Arabian sea dust is the Horn of Africa, which is
	completely wrong. Unfortunately, the Omani coast is much too wet
	in the CCM, and there is very little that can be done about this
	except waiting for an improved convection scheme.
	
	* Ran dstccm20: IBIS 0.4*vwc cly<0.1 rghmbl=50 fdg=0.01
