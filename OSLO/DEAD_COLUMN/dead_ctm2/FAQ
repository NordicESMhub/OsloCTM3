Answers:
1.1 Where can I get further information on DEAD

The DEAD homepage at http://dust.ps.uci.edu/dead is the central
repository for DEAD information.

The physical parameterizations used in the DEAD are fully described in 
<a href="ftp://dust.ps.uci.edu/pub/zender/ppr/ppr_ZBN02.pdf">this paper</a>, 
and the correct usage of the control parameters (e.g., tokens in
params.h and dst.h) are documented in those files.

2.1 Does DEAD work in single precision?

Yes. DEAD builds in double precision by default but works fine
in single precision. Build DEAD with 'make PRC=S' to switch to single 
precision. 

3.1 How does one run DEAD?

3.2 How do I correctly specify the wind speed or XXX?

4.1 How do I easily compare the results of multiple DEAD runs?

5.1 How do I change the number of dust size bins?
The number of size bins for DEAD is easily changed by editing the
preprocessor tokens DST_NBR in params.h to whatever number of
sizes are desired.
